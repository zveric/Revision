### Finance 
- Due to Henry's high spending (See: [[Henry's Personality]]) the goverment needed more money
- To gain this extra income a new system of taxation was used.
- Subsidies were added to the Direct taxation already present
- Taxation was unpopular and didn't compete with Henry's spending
#### The Amicable Grant
- Henry wanted to invade france while it was weak
- The Amicable grant aimed to rase money for this war quickly.
- It demanded that preists pay 1/3 of their income and everyone else paid 1/6 of their income towards the war effort.
- It failed massively asd people didnt want to pay.

### Enclosure
- Land owners had been fencing off common land to graze their animals
- This had a negative affect on poorer people as they no longer had space to rear animals for food. 
- As wolsey 'had humble beginings' (See: [[Wolsey's Rise to Power]] ) he helped these stuggling people by setting up a court to protest such matters.
- It failed due to the rich people becoming unhappy with the idea

### The Elthlam Ordinances
- Rules to keep Henry's palaces clean
- Reduce the Privy Chamber (See [[Features of Henry's goverment]]) to remove some of his rivals

### Justice
- Wolsey recognised that the justice system was flawed,slow and favored the rich. 
- He strengthened the court of the star chamber (Which was responsible for the justice system)
