### Finance 
- Due to Henry's high spending (See: [[Henry's Personality]]) the goverment needed more money
- To gain this extra income a new system of taxation was used.
- Subsidies were added to the Direct taxation already present
- Taxation was unpopular and didn't compete with Henry's spending

### Enclosure
- Land owners had been fencing off common land to graze their animals
- This had a negative affect on poorer people as they no longer had space to rear animals for food.
