## ‘The printing press led to significant progress in medical knowledge and treatment in the years c1500–c1700.’ How far do you agree? Explain your answer.


The renaissance was a time of great change throughout medicine due to the fall in control of the church, the development of new technology and the rebirth of traditional ideas through the work of individuals.

Before the printing press became widely available ideas spread slowly as books were often hand written by monks meaning that books were in short supply,expensive and were censored by the church. The development of the printing press allowed books to be mass produced allowing free flow of medical knowledge.

Key individuals tested old ideas with new science. This sudden challenge of ideas illustrates the change in society seen throughout the renaissance. Anatomy was challenged by new scientists such as Vesalius who disregarded the ideas of Galen and the Church preferring scientifically provable ideas that were found through experimentation.
