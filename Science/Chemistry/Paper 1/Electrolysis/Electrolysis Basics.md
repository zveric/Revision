## Electrolysis Introduction

Electrolysis is the process of oxidizing (removing an electron) or reducing (gaining an electron) an ion/element.
Electrolysis is often used to purify/refine metals that are more reactive than carbon, such as aluminum.

Electrolysis uses two electrodes that interact with the electrolyte, the cathode which is negatively charged to attract the positive cations, and the node which is positively charge to attract the negative anions.

The electrolyte is the fluid (Molten Ions) that electrolysis is being performed on.

At the anode, halides such as chlorine or fluorine always take presidence during oxidation.
