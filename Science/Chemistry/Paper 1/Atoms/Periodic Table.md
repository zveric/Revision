The Periodic table is set out with metals on the right and non-metals on the left. 
It is split into periods and groups. 
Each period (Horisontal) repersents a new electron shell and each group (Vertical) shows the number of electrons in the outer shell

## Parts of the table

### Alkali Metals (Group 1): 
- Get more reactive as you travel down the group due to outer electron being further from the nucleus.
- React with water to form a salt


### Halogens (Group 7):
- Less reactive lower down the group due to the outer shell being further from the nucleus making new electrons less likely to bond.


### Noble Gases (Group 8/0)
- Unreactive due to full outer shell of electrons

## History
- Dalton put elements in 'weight' order
- Newlands put elements with similar properties together
- Mendeleev put elements in columns and rows
