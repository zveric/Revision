### Chromatography: 
- Paper with a mixture on is dipped into a solvent and the inks separate up the paper. The highest climbing mixture is the most soluble in the solvent. Rf value = distance ink travelled / distance solvent front travelled.
    
### Filtration: 
- The use of filter paper to remove insoluble particles from a liquid.
    
### Distillation:
#### Simple distillation: 
- A conical flask with a mixture of a liquid and a soluble solid is heated until the liquid evaporates and travels up a tube this evaporated liquid is then cooled in the condenser so it becomes a liquid again.
#### Fractional distillation:
- Similar to simple distillation except there are glass rods in the tube that the gas flows up meaning that it can also be used for separating liquids with different boiling points
