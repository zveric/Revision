Simplest whole number ratio of the atoms of each element in a compound

### Example:
**A compound contains 43.66% phosphorus and 56.34% oxygen. The compound has a relative molecular mass of 284 g / mol. Determine the empirical formula of the compound and the molecular formula.**

#### Empirical 
1. Divide the percentage of each element in the compound by its reactive atomic mass
	- Phosphorus = 43.66%/31.0= 1.41 moles
	- Oxygen = 56.34%/16.0=3.52 moles
2. Work out the ratio by dividing both number by the smallest number
	- 1.41/1.41= 1
	- 3.52/1.41=2.5
3. Multiply both numbers up to create whole numbers
	- 1x2=2
	- 2.5x2=5
**Answer = P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
