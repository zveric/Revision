- Acids contain Hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>)
- Alkalis contain Hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>)

## Strengths of Acid

- Strong acids dissociate / ionise completely, producing mor H<sup>+</sup> ions
- Strong Acids have lower pHs (0,2)
- Weak Acids

### Dilute and Concentrated

- The more dilute and acid is the less H<sup>+</sup> there are per dm<sup>3</sup>
- The more Concentrated an acid is the more H<sup>+</sup> ions there are per dm<sup>3</sup>
