- Ionic bonding is when a metal and a non metal bond through shared electrons.
- The metal donates electrons and the non metal accepts the electrons.
- The overall charge must remain 0
- These ions often form lattices (grids of ions) so crysals are formed.
- High melting + boiling points
- Conducts electricity when moltenor in a solution as ions are free to move

### Example:
- Magnesium Chloride = Mg<sup>2+</sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup> --> MgCl<sup>2</sup>
- There are two Chlorine electrons to balance out the element.
