- A covelent bond is formed when a pair of electrons is shared between two atoms. Unlike [[Ionic Bonding]] which swaps electrons.
- Covelent bonding creates molicules
- No of electrons needed = Number of bonds created
- These bongs can continue to occur creating [[Giant Covelant Molicules]]
### Properties
- Low melting points
- Low boiling points 
- Poor conduction of electricity (Due to electrons being trapped in their positions)
