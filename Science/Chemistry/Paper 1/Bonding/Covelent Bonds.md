- A covelent bond is formed when a pair of electrons is shared between two atoms. Unlike [[Ionic Bonding]] witch swaps electrons.
- Covelent bonding creates molicules
### Properties
- Low melting points
- Low boiling points 
- Poor conduction of electricity (Due to electrons being trapped in their positions)
- Simple polymers contain large chains of bonds with carbon

### Allotropes of Carbon
- Graphite and Diamond are different forms of carbon
- They are both forms of covalentally bonded giant molecular structures
#### Graphite:
- 1 atom thick

#### Diamond:
- A Grid of atoms.
