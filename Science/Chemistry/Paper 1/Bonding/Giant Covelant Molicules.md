- Giant Covelent Molicules Are [[Covelent Bonds]] that go on for a long time. 

#### Allotropes of Carbon
- Graphite and Diamond are different forms of carbon
- They are both forms of covalentally bonded giant molecular structures

##### Graphine:
- 1 atom thick
- Delocalised electrons
- Multiple layers create Graphite

##### Diamond:
- A Grid of carbon atoms.

##### Fullerene
- 60 carbon atoms all joined
- Used as lubricant

##### Nano Tubes
- Carbon folded over itself
- Used as a lubricant.



### Polymers
- Carbon based molecules joined together creating a long chain
- High pressure and catalyst needed
